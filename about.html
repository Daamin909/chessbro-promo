      <h2 class="headings">im a ðŸ¤“, how does this work?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        okay so for the nerds, here is how this works briefly. firstly, the
        website fetches the game using the users chess.com username or the user
        enters the PGN (portable game notation). The PGN is validated and then
        converted to a list of FENs (forsythâ€“edwards notation) that basically
        represent the curren position of the board, and then this is where
        Stockfish comes in.
      </p>
      <h2 class="headings">what is stockfish?</h2>
      <p class="imgp paragraph">
        <img
          src="assets/stockfish.png"
          class="stockfish-img"
          alt="stockfish logo"
        />
        stockfish is an open-source chess engine. it analyses the current
        position and tells you the best move(s) and the game eval. Eval is a
        number based system used to describe who's better in the current
        position; ie "+1" means White is better by 1, "-1" means Black is better
        by 1 and so on. there is also stuff like "M6" or "M-6" which means
        checkmate can be forced by white and black respectively in 6 moves.
      </p>
      <h2 class="headings">cool, so what do you do with this info?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        here is where my algorithm comes in, chessbro compares the change in
        eval to classify the moves as excellent/best/good/blunder etc. then we
        use a list of openings, to determine the game's opening. I use a LOT of
        libraries in this process that do some heavy-lifting for me, so a HUGE
        thank you to all open-source contributors/maintainers that work on those
        libs.
