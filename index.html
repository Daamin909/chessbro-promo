        chess is a really cool game! It was invented by the Indians in the 6th
        century. Originally called, "Shatranj".

      <p class="paragraph">
        there are a lot of cool people that play chess, for example: Magnus
        Carlsen. he is what I call: beauty with brains. Bro is so smart and
        still managed to have a life and wife.

    <div class="why">
      <h2 class="headings">Lmao, why does ChessBro exist?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        the most popular chess website to ever exist is
        chess.com. They have managed to become a
        monopoly, with their only competition being
        LiChess which is an open-source and
        free alternative.
      </p>
      <h2 class="headings">okay and?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        people generally prefer chess.com due to lichess.org having worse UI,
        less modes, less creative stuff etc. HOWEVER, chess.com has ADs, and a
        lot of its features are locked behind paywall, among them is Game
        Review. Which helps you to analyse your chess game after you've played
        it to get better. BUT, it is only free with a limit of 1 review per day
        ðŸ˜•
      </p>
      <h2 class="headings">oooo, so what do you propose?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I present to you, âœ¨ ChessBro âœ¨. It
        is a free and open-source alt to chess.com's Game Review. It is still
        under development. I have release a browser-extension and CLI - App for
        chessbro as well. In the future, I also plan to release a cross-platform
        mobile application for chess.com. <h1 class="paragraph" style="font-size: 30px; color: #87d5ff">GO CHECK IT OUT AND SUPPORT CHESSBRO!!</h1>
